# OSM Road Graph Extractor

This project is a simple command-line tool that reads a .osm.pbf file containing OpenStreetMap data and generates a road graph in the form of two CSV files: one for the nodes and one for the edges. The road graph can be used for various purposes, such as routing or visualizing the road network.

## Running
```
cargo run --release -- /path/to/your/file.pbf
